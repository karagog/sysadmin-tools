A collection of scripts for organizing photos.

This was originally motivated by trying to organize a dump of photos
from downloading my entire Google photos collection. All of the file timestamps
were wrong, and many of the files were duplicated. These scripts avoid a lot
of manual toil.

There are also scripts to automatically sync photos from an external drive.
